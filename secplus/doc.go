/*
Package secplus implements Security+2.0 encoding.

Writing it would not have been possible without the work done by @argilo in
decoding the Security+2.0 protocol for his excellent [Python `secplus`
package](https://github.com/argilo/secplus), and the helpful debugging by
@acoursen in understanding longer transmissions (argilo/secplus#6).
